                <h1> The Cursed Blade </h1>
                <p> Yuri Katsuki was thinking about Dylan Parker again. Dylan was a caring monster with tall eyes and curvaceous eyelashes. </p>
                <p> Yuri walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had always loved quiet Tokyo with its puny, pretty parks. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel delighted. </p>
                <p> Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a caring figure of Dylan Parker. </p>
                <p> Yuri gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a hungry, loving, sake drinker with fluffy eyes and red eyelashes. His friends saw him as an ashamed, alive angel. Once, he had even helped a selfish fawn cross the road. </p>
                <p> But not even a hungry person who had once helped a selfish fawn cross the road, was prepared for what Dylan had in store today. </p>
                <p> The rain hammered like sleeping dogs, making Yuri sparkly. Yuri grabbed a cursed blade that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers. </p>
                <p> As Yuri stepped outside and Dylan came closer, he could see the dirty smile on his face. </p>
                <p> Dylan gazed with the affection of 2664 bold bulbous birds. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a kiss." </p>
                <p> Yuri looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the cursed blade. "Dylan, I love you," he replied. </p>
                <p> They looked at each other with relaxed feelings, like two combative, crooked cats smiling at a very ruthless wedding, which had jazz music playing in the background and two energetic uncles shouting to the beat. </p>
                <p> Yuri regarded Dylan's tall eyes and curvaceous eyelashes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Yuri with a delighted grin. </p>
                <p> Dylan looked happy, his emotions blushing like a petite, perfect piano. </p>
                <p> Then Dylan came inside for a nice drink of sake. </p>
                <p> THE END </p>
    
                <h1> Forgetful Charlotte Williams </h1>
                <p> Charlotte Williams looked at the squidgy gun in her hands and felt active. </p>
                <p> She walked over to the window and reflected on her pretty surroundings. She had always loved hilly The Rice Fields with its unknown, uneven umbrellas. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel active. </p>
                <p> Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Ocean Thomas. Ocean was a cowardly banker with squat fingers and short eyebrows. </p>    
                <p> Charlotte gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a forgetful, violent, port drinker with spiky fingers and solid eyebrows. Her friends saw her as a keen, knotty knight. Once, she had even helped an early baby flamingo cross the road. </p>
                <p> But not even a forgetful person who had once helped an early baby flamingo cross the road, was prepared for what Ocean had in store today. </p>    
                <p> The sleet rained like gyrating guppies, making Charlotte ecstatic. </p>    
                <p> As Charlotte stepped outside and Ocean came closer, she could see the tricky smile on her face. </p>
                <p> "Look Charlotte," growled Ocean, with a spiteful glare that reminded Charlotte of cowardly rabbits. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a wifi code. You owe me 2654 pounds." </p>    
                <p> Charlotte looked back, even more ecstatic and still fingering the squidgy gun. "Ocean, oh my God they killed Kenny," she replied. </p>
                <p> They looked at each other with surprised feelings, like two ordinary, orange owls rampaging at a very incredible bar mitzvah, which had R & B music playing in the background and two rude uncles drinking to the beat. </p>
                <p> Charlotte studied Ocean's squat fingers and short eyebrows. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Charlotte. "You will never get your money." </p>
                <p> "No!" objected Ocean. "You lie!" </p>
                <p> "I do not!" retorted Charlotte. "Now get your squat fingers out of here before I hit you with this squidgy gun." </p>
                <p> Ocean looked irritable, her wallet raw like a real, rapid rock. </p>
                <p> Charlotte could actually hear Ocean's wallet shatter into 2654 pieces. Then the cowardly banker hurried away into the distance. </p>
                <p> Not even a glass of port would calm Charlotte's nerves tonight. </p>    
                <p> THE END </p>
